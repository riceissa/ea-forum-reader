# EA Forum Reader

A fast and JavaScript-free way to browse the [Effective Altruism
Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/) (and LessWrong 2.0).

[LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) : [GreaterWrong](https://www.greaterwrong.com/) (and [LessWrong 2.0 Reader](https://lw2.issarice.com/)) :: [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/) : [EA Forum Reader](https://eaforum.issarice.com/) (and [ea.greaterwrong.com](https://ea.greaterwrong.com/))
